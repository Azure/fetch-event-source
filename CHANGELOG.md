# CHANGELOG

## 3.0.0
- Adjust parse.getMessages signature
- Add node.js support
- Upgrade to TypeScript 4.9
- Add exports in package.json
- This package is now pure ESM. Please [read this](https://gist.github.com/sindresorhus/a39789f98801d908bbc7ff3ecc99d99c).

## 2.0.1
This release adds support for esmodule imports (see #4).

## 2.0.0
This release improves the performance of parsing the response stream and fixes some corner cases to better match [the spec](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/server-sent-events.html#event-stream-interpretation).

### Changed
- The `id`, `event`, and `data` fields are now initialized to empty strings, per the spec (they were previously `undefined`)
- The `onmessage` callback is now called for _all_ messages (it was previously triggered only for messages with a `data` field)
- If a message contains multiple `data` fields, they will be concatenated together into a single string. For example, the following message:
    ````
    data: Foo
    data:Bar
    data
    data: Baz
    ````
    will result in `{ data: 'Foo\nBar\n\nBaz' }`

- If the server sends an `id` field with an empty value, the last-event-id header will no longer be sent on the next reconnect.

### Removed
- The internal `parseStream` function has been removed. The parse implementation was previously based on async generators, which required a lot of supporting code in both the typescript-generated polyfill as well as the javascript engine. The new implementation is based on simple callbacks, which should be much faster.

## 1.0.2
### Changed
- Updated examples in readme to fix typos, added more comments.
- Changed `if` statements in parse.ts to test for specific values instead of truthy/falsy values.

## 1.0.1
### Changed
- Changed the default onOpen validator to allow charset and boundary directives in the content-type
